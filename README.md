## Overview

The Physics course provided concepts in physics through 3-D graphic–environment applications. Through physics modeling and simulation, students will translate physical formulas into mathematical models to understand real-world phenomena such as motion and collisions.

## Projects

+ 1.Point Mass Euler
	+ This lab renders two balls by using Newton’s  second law and Euler method to update the velocity and position of the particle. The DirectX translation Matrix, D3DXMatrixTranslation helps in translating the ball in real-time.
	
+ 2.Velocity Verlet
	+ This lab renders two balls by using Newton’s  second law and Velocity Verlet method to update the velocity and position of the particle. The DirectX translation Matrix, D3DXMatrixTranslation , helps translating the ball in real-time . 
	
+ 3.Verlet Integration
	+ In this lab , we will render 2 balls by using Newton’s  second law and Verlet Integration method to update the velocity and position of the particle.The DirectX translation Matrix, D3DXMatrixTranslation, helps translating the ball in real-time. Note: in this simulation, no gravity is involved.
	
+ 4.Point-Mass Impulse Based Collision Response
	+ This lab, renders three balls and have them collide to each other. Collisions are detected by applying the sphere-to-sphere collision detection.

+ 5.Rigid Body Impulse Based Collision Response
	+ This lab is very similar to the previous one. The main difference between lab4 and lab5 is that the first applies only the mass to a point an the second applied to the whole rigid body.

+ 6.Bouncing Ball
	+ A rigid body (ball) is rendered and have it collide with the ground (immovable surface). A collision is detected between the ball bounding sphere and a plane(ground) by applying the sphere-plane Collision detection. The collision response  with friction is based on Newton’s impulse collision law  with friction.

+ 7.Friction Simulation
	+ This project simulates dynamic and static frictions in the 3 stages: Dynamic(sliding) friction, stable static(dry) friction and unstable static(dry) friction in real-time.
